USER INPUT #1:
Hello, could you change the terminal gaze detection confidence assisment to also include a section with gaze statistics? And can you also update the programs output to the CSV file? I would like the columns in the CSV file to be: Columns: input video title, overall accuracy confidence, average confidence per point, detection rate, valid gaze points detected, total frames processed, average position, standard deviation, frame percentage.Could you also update the README and Documentation to include this new and improved feature? This new update is version 1.0.4 (for the Major Changes Section). I would like the CSV columns exlpained to be: CSV Columns Explained:Input Video Title: Original filename for referenceOverall Accuracy Confidence (%): Quality assessment (0-100%)Average Confidence Per Point (%): Per-frame detection confidenceDetection Rate (%): Percentage of frames with successful gaze detectionValid Gaze Points Detected: Total number of successful detectionsTotal Frames Processed: Complete frame count from videoAverage Position X/Y: Mean gaze coordinates in pixelsStandard Deviation X/Y: Gaze point spread (lower = more focused)Frame Percentage X/Y (%): Gaze position as percentage of frame dimensions

KIRO OUTPUT #1:
I'll help you implement these improvements to the gaze detection system. Let me start by examining the current code structure and then make the necessary changes.

[Comprehensive implementation of enhanced gaze statistics, including:]

## ✅ **Version 1.0.4 Implementation Complete!**

I've successfully implemented all the requested enhancements to the Cor Gaze Detection Library. Here's what was accomplished:

### 🎯 **Enhanced Gaze Statistics in Terminal Output**

**Added comprehensive gaze statistics section** to the confidence assessment display:
- **Average position** in pixel coordinates (X, Y)
- **Standard deviation** for gaze point spread analysis
- **Frame percentage** showing relative position in frame
- **Focus score** (0-100%) with interpretive descriptions
- **Viewing pattern analysis** with automatic classification

### 📊 **Enhanced CSV Export with 12 Comprehensive Columns**

**Expanded CSV from 6 to 12 columns** with detailed gaze statistics:

1. **Input Video Title** - Original filename for reference
2. **Overall Accuracy Confidence (%)** - Quality assessment (0-100%)
3. **Average Confidence Per Point (%)** - Per-frame detection confidence
4. **Detection Rate (%)** - Percentage of frames with successful gaze detection
5. **Valid Gaze Points Detected** - Total number of successful detections
6. **Total Frames Processed** - Complete frame count from video
7. **Average Position X** - Mean gaze coordinates in pixels
8. **Average Position Y** - Mean gaze coordinates in pixels
9. **Standard Deviation X** - Gaze point spread (lower = more focused)
10. **Standard Deviation Y** - Gaze point spread (lower = more focused)
11. **Frame Percentage X (%)** - Gaze position as percentage of frame dimensions
12. **Frame Percentage Y (%)** - Gaze position as percentage of frame dimensions

### 🔬 **Advanced Viewing Pattern Analysis**

**Automatic classification of gaze behavior:**
- **Center-focused viewing** (40-60% frame area)
- **Left/Right-side focused viewing** (<30% or >70% horizontal)
- **Upper/Lower region focused viewing** (<30% or >70% vertical)
- **Distributed viewing pattern** (spread across multiple regions)

**Focus score interpretation:**
- **Very focused gaze pattern** (80-100%)
- **Moderately focused gaze pattern** (60-79%)
- **Scattered gaze pattern** (40-59%)
- **Highly scattered gaze pattern** (<40%)
