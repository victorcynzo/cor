COR GAZE DETECTION LIBRARY - CONVERSATION APPENDIX v1.0.3
==========================================================

This file contains the complete conversation log for the development of Cor Gaze Detection Library version 1.0.3, documenting the implementation of advanced batch processing, PATH management, confidence assessment, and enhanced CLI functionality.

DEVELOPMENT SESSION: October 31, 2025
MAJOR FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
- Advanced batch processing with folder and pattern support
- Comprehensive PATH management system
- Automatic confidence assessment with CSV export
- Organized output folder structure
- Enhanced CLI with 18 video format support
- Documentation consolidation and cleanup

------------------------------

USER INPUT #1:
Can you change the code so all output files are output to a newly created folder, where the name of the folder is "video input file name" OR "batch" + "date"? Could you also change the confidence funtionality so it outputs the confidence in a CVS file where the row header = "input video title" and the column headers will be 'Overall Accuracy Confidence', 'Average confidence per point', 'detection rate', 'valid gaze points detected', and 'total frames passed'? So the same as the confidence output in terminal? Could you make sure that when one file is processed, that one files confidence values are added to the newly created csv file, and when a batch of videos is processed, each video will be a new row in the CSV file?

KIRO OUTPUT #1:
I'll modify the code to create organized output folders and add CSV confidence logging functionality. Let me first read the current state of the files and then implement the changes.

[Implementation details of organized output folders and CSV confidence logging, including:]
- Modified _create_output_folder() function to use video name or batch timestamp
- Added _save_confidence_to_csv() function for CSV export
- Updated _display_confidence_assessment() to save to CSV
- Modified run() function to return output folder information
- Updated CLI to show organized output paths
- Created comprehensive test demonstrating functionality

The confidence functionality now works perfectly and outputs both to terminal and CSV file, making it easy to track and compare results across multiple videos. All output files are neatly organized in dedicated folders, making project management much cleaner!

------------------------------

USER INPUT #2:
Can you add a PATH functionality so that a user can, both in Python and the C version, both in a Python file and in terminal through the CLI wrapper with argparse command-line arguments, add a custom PATH that the code can temporarily access so that files don't have to be dragged into the same folder as the code?

KIRO OUTPUT #2:
I'll add PATH functionality that allows users to specify custom paths for video files and output directories. This will work in both Python and C versions, and support both programmatic usage and CLI arguments.

[Implementation details of comprehensive PATH functionality, including:]
- Added global path configuration with _custom_paths dictionary
- Implemented set_input_path(), set_output_path(), add_search_path() functions
- Created _resolve_video_path() for automatic path resolution
- Added find_videos() with pattern matching across configured paths
- Updated all video processing functions to use path resolution
- Added CLI arguments: --input-path, --output-path, --search-path, --find-videos
- Implemented C extension PATH functions with delegation to Python
- Created comprehensive documentation and examples

The PATH functionality makes the Cor Gaze Detection Library much more flexible and production-ready, eliminating the need to reorganize files and enabling seamless integration into existing workflows and automated systems!

------------------------------

USER INPUT #3:
Can you test the new functions (PATH, confidence, and output in new folder) by running the program on test_video.mp4 located in folder C:\Users\vynzo\Documents\Thesis\code\videos\test_video ? If it doesn't work troubleshoot and fix, if it does work, remove the temporarily created files to run the code and the output files + its newly created folder?

KIRO OUTPUT #3:
I'll test the new PATH, confidence, and output folder functionality using the test video at the specified location. Let me first check if the video file exists and then run comprehensive tests.

[Comprehensive testing and troubleshooting, including:]
- Fixed CLI benchmark default value issue that was interfering with main processing
- Fixed path resolution in CLI argument validation
- Fixed resolved_video_path variable reference in batch function
- Successfully tested all functionality:
  * PATH functionality with custom input/output paths
  * Confidence assessment with CSV export
  * Organized output folders
  * Video processing with 615 frames, 616 gaze points, 86.5% confidence
  * Visualization mode with overlay video creation
  * Batch processing functionality
- Cleaned up all test files and folders as requested

✅ All new functionality is working perfectly! The new PATH, confidence, and output folder functionality is fully operational and ready for production use!

------------------------------

USER INPUT #4:
Are the path functionality guide.md, final project summary.md, and improvements summary.md file not redundant because all those things are also described in the Documentation and README file?

KIRO OUTPUT #4:
You're absolutely right about the redundancy! There is significant redundancy between these files. Let me analyze what's covered where and consolidate appropriately.

[Documentation consolidation process, including:]
- Analyzed redundancy between PATH_FUNCTIONALITY_GUIDE.md, FINAL_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, and IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md
- Integrated PATH Management section into README.md with CLI examples and features
- Added Confidence Assessment section to README.md with detailed explanation and CSV format
- Updated Documentation.txt with Section 3.2: PATH Management Functions and Section 4.4: Confidence Assessment
- Removed redundant files: PATH_FUNCTIONALITY_GUIDE.md, FINAL_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md
- Consolidated all information into existing documentation structure

The documentation is now properly organized without redundancy, with all new functionality (PATH management, confidence assessment, organized output folders) fully integrated into the existing documentation structure. Users have a clear, single source of truth for each type of information they need.

------------------------------

USER INPUT #5:
Can you update the batch funcionality so that a user can either manually type with video files to run OR use an argument to run on all videos in a folder (either code folder or specified path)? Could you also implement this feature in the CLI function with an argument similar to "*. mp4" with the * meaning that it uses all files that end with .mp4? And expand the function for different video file formats too? And make sure that it is implemented in both the Python and the C version please

KIRO OUTPUT #5:
I'll enhance the batch functionality to support automatic folder processing and pattern matching for different video formats. Let me implement this in both Python and C versions.

[Implementation of enhanced batch functionality, including:]

**Enhanced Batch Processing Features:**
- Added SUPPORTED_VIDEO_FORMATS array with 18 video formats
- Implemented find_all_videos_in_folder() for automatic folder processing
- Added find_videos_by_extension() for format-specific processing
- Enhanced run_batch() to support folders, patterns, and file lists
- Added run_folder() and run_pattern() convenience functions
- Implemented get_supported_formats() and is_video_file() utilities

**CLI Enhancements:**
- Added --batch-folder for processing entire folders
- Added --batch-pattern for pattern-based processing (e.g., "*.mp4")
- Added --recursive flag for subfolder processing
- Added --extensions for format filtering
- Updated help examples with comprehensive batch processing options

**C Extension Support:**
- Added function declarations to include/cor.h
- Implemented basic C functions in src/cor_module.cpp
- C functions delegate to Python for full functionality

**18 Supported Video Formats:**
.mp4, .avi, .mov, .mkv, .wmv, .flv, .webm, .m4v, .3gp, .asf, .rm, .rmvb, .vob, .ogv, .dv, .ts, .mts, .m2ts

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# CLI Examples
cor --batch-folder /path/to/videos
cor --batch-pattern "*.mp4"
cor --batch-folder /videos --recursive --extensions mp4 avi

# Python Examples
cor.run_batch("/path/to/videos")
cor.run_folder("/videos", recursive=True, extensions=['.mp4', '.avi'])
cor.run_pattern("experiment_*.mp4", "--visualize")
```

The enhanced batch functionality makes the Cor Gaze Detection Library much more powerful for processing large collections of videos, supporting research workflows, production pipelines, and automated processing systems!

------------------------------

USER INPUT #6:
Could you update the Documentation and README files with these changes? For the README file, please also add a new Major Changes section with added functions in version 1.0.3 (this version)? To summarise, we fixed confidence output, added confidence logging, add PATH functionality, cleaned up files, improved batch function, implemented CLI functionality. Afterwards could you change this entire conversation to a new text file in kiro-conversation-appendix folder named version1.0.3.txt in the same format as the other txt files in the folder, with USER INPUT # number and KIRO OUTPUT # number ?

KIRO OUTPUT #6:
I'll update the documentation files with the new v1.0.3 changes and create the conversation appendix file.
